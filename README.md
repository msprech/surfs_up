# Evaluation of Surf Shack Business Proposal Using SQLite

## Purpose 

This report analyzes weather trends and patterns in Oahu, Hawaii throughout the months of June and December from 2010-2017 in order to determine how this would impact the success of the proposed surf and shake business. 

Investors asked for an analysis of the months of June and December to better determine if this business would be sustainable year-round. 

## Results 

![dec summary](https://github.com/msprech/surfs_up/blob/7cd88686494159e7c448ef537611a0e89c305fe8/Dec%20Temps.png) ![june summary](https://github.com/msprech/surfs_up/blob/7cd88686494159e7c448ef537611a0e89c305fe8/June%20Temps.png)

As shown in the above summary statistic dataframes for December and June, the average temperatures were relatively consistent throughout the year. 

* Minimum temperatures were close to 10 degrees different (Dec: 56, June: 64), however, 
* Mean temperatures were less than 4 degrees apart (Dec: 71.04, June: 74.94) and, 
* Max temperatures were only 2 degrees apart (Dec: 83, June: 85


## Summary 

In terms of temperature, the analysis showed strong support in favor of the surf and shake shop. Although the months of December do show overall cooler temperatures, the averages were comparable to June and unlikely to discourage patrons from visiting the shop. 

However, further analysis should be conducted both on precipitation levels and on other seasonal weather patterns that could impact surfing conditions. Other important factors to consider include the dates of popular surfing competitions, the locations of other competitors, and what seasons draw what skill level of surfer.
